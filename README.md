# ROS2
## 1.Introduction for ros2-Humble Hawksbill

### What is ROS? 
Robot Operating System 

### Version of ros?
**Ros** : 1st version. 
 
**Ros 2**: 2nd version (is now stable).
- In this tutorial, we use Humble Hawksbill version

### Why ros?
- Provided a standard for robotic application 
- Use on any robot
- Code separation and communication tools 
- Save you a huge amount of time and prevent you from reinventing the wheel 
- Is a language agnostic, so we can program in diferents languages like python or c++

### When to use ROS2?

Help you develop powerful and scalable robot applications, so when you need a lot of communicaction 

## 2.Tools we use 

**Terminal window**
 - Command prompt

**Visual studio**
- Code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications
- You can also install Microsoft Visual Studio Code from your Ubuntu's GUI
  
**Terminator**
- Its a improved terminal where you can split easily in four any layout
- To install it `sudo apt install terminator`

**Pip3**
- The official package manager and pip command for Python 3
- To install it `sudo apt install python3-pip`

**Colcon**
- Is a build tool and was created specify for ros2 
- To install it `sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions`
- Put this line in your bashrc file

```
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
```


## 3.language libraries 
### rlc ### 
 - Is a ros library and it means Ross Client Library also is a  library which contains all the functionalities 

rclpy 
 - python

rclcpp 
 - c++

## 4.Debug and monitor the nodes
cat ~/.bashrc - line to service our cross to global installation and the line to service our cross to workspace 
make sure you have this lines, if you donÂ´t added to the bashrc file 

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash
```

you can also source directly if you are not sure that the new version you made was source

```
source ~/.bashtc
```

if you put ros2 with tab, you can see all the commands that you get 
remember ros pkg is for create a package 
run is for running a program with this you need a package and executable 


ros run -h is for get some help about the command
ros2 node list -> allow you to see all the nodes 

ros2 node info /node -> will you give you some information about subscribers

### Remame a Node at Runtime 

if you have differents nodes but with the same name, you will have problems when you run o get information,so for change the name you need to do 

run the package and then you will add 

ros2 run my_py_pkg py_node --ros-args --remap __node:=name of the node 

you can see the node have the original name when you run it, but with this line you change the name temporaly 


## 6.Colcon 

to build your workspace you need 

```
colcon build
```
if you want to build a specific package 
```
colcon build --packages-select #+name of the package 
```
