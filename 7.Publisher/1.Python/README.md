cd ../.. - for back to the src file code . -for open visual studio

the publisher allows us to send some messages to a topic

every package that we are gonna use in yourproyect, we are gonna add a dependency in package.xml

queue size is for create a buffer so that you can make sure that all the messages are gonna be sent and so the buffer here will contai 10 messages

we create a publisher but we need a data

in setup.py, console scripts, add the executable executable name = package name.filename:main def main

whe you create a new file,you create a new file you create here a new execute table, you need to do call convert

colcon build --symlink-install
